COOPER: I'm Anderson Cooper. Thanks for joining us. We've already welcomed the candidates on stage. They are in place at their podiums. Before we dive into the issues, I want to quickly explain some of the groundrules tonight. <br>As the moderator, I'll ask questions, followups and guide the discussion. I'll be joined in the questioning by CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash, a well as Don Lemon who will share questions from Democrats around the country. Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions, and 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals. I'll give candidates time to respond if they have been singled out for criticism. <br>Our viewers should know that we have lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. <br>I want the candidates to be able to introduce themselves to our audience. Each candidate will have two minutes to introduce themselves. <br>Let's begin with Governor Chafee. <br>Governor? <br><br>CHAFEE: Thank you, Anderson. <br>Thank you, CNN, and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node104">Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node111">we also will be electing a world leader</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node118">Voters should assess the candidate's experience, character and vision for the future</span> as <span class="highlighted" id="node123">they make this important decision</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node143">I'm the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node150">As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node157">I was reelected three times</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node164">As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node171">I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node178">As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node185">Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node192">It happens to be Nevada, where we're having this debate</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node199">I'm very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node206">I've always been honest</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node213">I have the courage to take the long-term view, and I've shown good judgment</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node235">I have high ethical standards</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node258">As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the have-nots</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node265">I want to address climate change</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node272">a real threat to our planet</span>.

on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now, 
some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node168">We're going
 to start with guns</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node175">The shooting in Oregon earlier this month, once 
again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation. Over 
the last week, guns have been the most discussed political topic on 
Facebook by two to one.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node182">Senator Sanders, you voted against the Brady 
bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node187">You also 
supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak 
trains</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node192">For a decade, you said that holding gun manufacturers legally 
responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node197">Now, you say you're 
reconsidering that</span>. Which is it: <span class="highlighted" id="node202">shield the gun companies from lawsuits 
or not?</span><br><br>SANDERS : Let's begin, Anderson, by understanding that <span class="highlighted" id="node240">
Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA</span>. Let's also
 understand that <span class="highlighted" id="node250">back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States 
Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont 
and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has 
virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons</span>. And
 <span class="highlighted" id="node255">over the years, I have strongly avoided instant background checks, 
doing away with this terrible gun show loophole</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node260">I think we've got 
to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man 
purchasers</span>. Also <span class="highlighted" id="node265">I believe, and I've fought for, to understand that 
there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal, 
who are homicidal, but can't get the healthcare that they need, the 
mental healthcare, because they don't have insurance or they're too 
poor</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node270">I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis 
has got to get mental health counseling immediately</span>.<br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node308">Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits?</span><br><br>SANDERS
 : <span class="highlighted" id="node325">Of course not</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node342">This was a large and complicated bill</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node347">There were 
provisions in it that I think made sense</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node352">For example, do I think that a
 gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, 
and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop 
owner should be held responsible? I don't</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node357">On the other hand, where you 
have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to
 criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action</span>.<br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node362">Secretary Clinton, is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns?</span><br><br>CLINTON
 : <span class="highlighted" id="node392">No, not at all</span>. I think that <span class="highlighted" id="node407">we have to look at the fact that we lose
 90 people a day from gun violence</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node412">This has gone on too long and it 's 
time the entire country stood up against the NRA</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node417">The majority of our 
country ... [ applause ] ... supports background checks, and even the 
majority of gun owners do</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node422">Senator Sanders did vote five times against 
the Brady bill</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node427">Since it was passed, more than 2 million prohibited 
purchases have been prevented</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node432"> He also did vote, as he said, for this 
immunity provision</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node437">I voted against it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node449">I was in the Senate at the same 
time</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node454">It wasn't that complicated to me</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node459">It was pretty straightforward to
 me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America</span>. 
<span class="highlighted" id="node464">Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers</span>. And

that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope 
all of us want, and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who 
should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are 
seeing</span>. I believe that <span class="highlighted" id="node545">there is a consensus in this country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node550">A consensus
 has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do
 away with this gun show loophole, that we have to address the issue of 
mental health, that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue</span>, 
and that<span class="highlighted" id="node555"> when we develop that consensus, we can finally, finally do 
something to address this issue</span>.<br><br>COOPER : <span class="highlighted" id="node594">Governor O'Malley, you

Democratic-controlled legislature</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node601">President Obama couldn't convince 
Congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in Aurora, in 
Newtown, and Charleston</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node608">How can you?</span><br><br>O'MALLEY : And, Anderson, <span class="highlighted" id="node615">I
 also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own 
party to get this done</span>. Look, it's fine to talk about all of these 
things - and I'm glad we're talking about these things - but <span class="highlighted" id="node626">I've 
actually done them</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node631"> We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not 
by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node648">We 
actually did it</span>. And, Anderson, <span class="highlighted" id="node676">here tonight in our audience are two 
people that make this issue very, very real</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node681">Sandy and Lonnie Phillips 
are here from Colorado. And their daughter, Jessie, was one of those who
 lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora</span>. Now, <span class="highlighted" id="node686">to try to 
transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does
 happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about
 a - a rigged game, Senator? The game was rigged</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node691"> A man had sold 4,000 
rounds of military ammunition to this - this person that killed their 
daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn't even ask 
where it was going</span>. And<span class="highlighted" id="node696"> not only did their case get thrown out of court,
 they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node701">because of the way that

Welcome back to Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, and the very first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential campaign. Ten candidates on the stage, selected based on their standing in five national polls. And tonight they are facing off, answering the questions you want asked. We hope. [laughter] <br><br>WALLACE: Gentlemen, we're obviously digging into some subjects in depth, but we're also going to change it up every once in a while throughout the next hour and have many rounds where we ask, you are not going to like it, only a couple of candidates questions on those subjects. This is the first of the many rounds, and it's about somebody whose name probably hasn't been mentioned enough so far tonight. <br>Governor Kasich, let me start with you. Whoever the Republican nominee -- [applause] <br><span class="highlighted" id="node1">Whoever the Republican nominee is, it looks at least for now like whoever that nominee is, he or she, will be facing off against Hillary Clinton</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">You know how she will come after whoever the Republican nominee is</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node13">She will say that you, whoever it is, support the rich while she supports the middle class</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node20">That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node27">She wants to move the country forward while you, the Republicans, want to take the country back to the past</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node34">How will you, if you're the nominee, how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on?</span> <br><br>KASICH: <span class="highlighted" id="node41">Let's start off with my father being a mailman</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node48">I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom have trouble, you know, making ends meet</span>. But I think <span class="highlighted" id="node55">she will come in a narrow way</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node62">The nominee of this party, if they're going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node69">Which is balancing budgets</span>. You know, <span class="highlighted" id="node76">we were talking about it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node83"><span class="highlighted" id="node90">People were saying, could we do it<span class="highlighted hlcurrent" id="node282">?</span></span></span> <span class="highlighted" id="node91">I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node98">when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node103">Economic growth is the key</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node134">Economic growth is the key to everything</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node123">once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don't seem to ever think that they get a fair deal</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node129">that includes people in our minority community</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node141">that includes people who feel as though they don't have a chance to move up</span>. <br>You know,<span class="highlighted" id="node148"> America is a miracle country</span>.

[laughter] <br>But you know, <span class="highlighted" id="node209">the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive -- the secular progressive movement</span>.

And <span class="highlighted" id="node275">that's what she's doing</span>. [applause] <br>WALLACE: Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to the subject of the economy, jobs and money and the government. And Governor Bush, I'm going to start with you. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node1">You have made a bold promise in your announcement</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">You have promised four percent economic growth and 19 million new jobs if you are fortunate enough to serve two terms as president</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node13">That many jobs, 19 million, would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node26">four percent growth, the last president to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War</span>. So question, <span class="highlighted" id="node39">how on Earth specifically would you pull that off?</span> <br><br>BUSH: <span class="highlighted" id="node52">We've done it 27 times since World War II</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node59">we need to lift our spirits and have high, lofty expectations for this great country of ours</span>. <br><span class="highlighted" id="node75">The new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can't do anything about is so dangerous for our country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node82">There's 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node89">6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node96">We've created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node103">the net result is we're not growing fast</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node114">income's not growing</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node125">A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node132">You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node171">You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn't suppress wages and kill jobs</span>. [applause] <br><span class="highlighted" id="node182">You embrace the energy revolution in our country</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node193">This president and Hillary Clinton, who can't even say she's for the XL pipeline even after she's left?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node200">Give me a break</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node207">Of course we're for it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node214">We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth</span>. And frankly, [timer sounds] <span class="highlighted" id="node223">fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node228">We can do this</span>. [applause] <br>WALLACE : Governor Walker . [ applause ] <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Governor Walker , when you ran for governor of Wisconsin back in 2010 , you promised that you would create 250,000 jobs in your first term , first four years</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node7">In fact , Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node18">Now you 're running for president , and you 're promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node25">Given your record in Wisconsin , why should voters believe you </span>? <br><br>WALKER : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node36">the voters in Wisconsin elected me last year for the third time</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node47">they wanted someone who aimed high , not aimed low</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node105">Before I came in , the unemployment rate was over eight percent . It 's now down to 4.6 percent</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node68">We 've more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node73">And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally</span> . You know , <span class="highlighted" id="node116">people like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node121">One report last year showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington , D.C.</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node126">I think most of us in America understand that people , not the government creates jobs</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node144">one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way </span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node155">repeal Obamacare</span> , put in -- <span class="highlighted" id="node166">reign in all the out of control regulations</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node177">put in place an all of the above energy policy</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node189">give people the education , the skills that the need to succeed</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node222">lower the tax rate and reform the tax code</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node233">That 's what I 'll do as president</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node244">just like I did in Wisconsin</span> . [ applause ] <br>WALLACE : <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Governor Christie , I want to engage you and Governor Huckabee in a subject that is a big issue in both of your campaigns , and that is entitlement reform</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node93">You say that you -- to save the system that you want to raise the retirement age -- have to raise the retirement age , and to cut benefits for Social Security and Medicare</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node18">you say that some of the candidates here on the stage are lying</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node30">Governor Huckabee says he can save Social Security and Medicare without doing any of that</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node104">Is he lying</span> ? <br><br>CHRISTIE : <span class="highlighted" id="node127">No , he 's not lying</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node144">he 's just wrong</span> . I mean , so , <span class="highlighted" id="node157">there 's a difference</span> -- <span class="highlighted" id="node164">I 'm the only guy on this stage who 's put out a detailed , 12 point plan on entitlement reform</span> and here 's why -- because <span class="highlighted" id="node179">71 % of federal spending right now is on entitlements , and debt service , 71 % </span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node190">we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29 % , and no time on the 71 % , and that makes no sense</span> . Now , <span class="highlighted" id="node201">let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security</span> . Yes , <span class="highlighted" id="node215">we 'd raise the retirement age two years , and phase it in over 25 years</span> , that means <span class="highlighted" id="node220">we 'd raise it one month a year for 25 years when we 're all living longer , and living better lives</span> . Secondly , <span class="highlighted" id="node243">we would means test Social Security for those who are making over $ 200,000 dollars a year in retirement income , and have $ 4 to $ 5 million dollars in liquid assets saved</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node248">They do n't need that Social Security check</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node253">Social Security is meant to be -- to make sure that no one who 's worked hard , and played by the rules , and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node266">If we do n't deal with this problem</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node271">it will bankrupt our country , or lead to massive tax increases , neither one that we want in this country</span> . [ applause ] <br><br>WALLACE : <span class="highlighted" id="node313">Governor Huckabee ? You say that changing entitlements , the kind of thing that Governor Christie is talking about , would be breaking a promise to the American people</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node326">you say that you can keep those programs , save Social Security , save Medicare , without those kinds of reforms through a FairTax , which is a broad tax on consumption</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node365">Please explain to Governor Christie how that would work , and how you could save these programs without the kind of painful reforms he says we need</span> ? <br><br>HUCKABEE : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node372">let 's all be reminded , 60 million Americans are on Social Security , 60 million</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node379">A third of those people depend on 90 % of their income from Social Security</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node386">Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node393">The government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not</span> . And , <span class="highlighted" id="node400">if person goes to 65 , they 're going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck</span> . Now , here 's the point , <span class="highlighted" id="node412">whose fault is it that the system is screwed up ? Is it the recipients , or is it the government</span> ? And , if <span class="highlighted" id="node427">Congress wants to mess with the retirement program</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node432">why do n't we let them start by changing their retirement program , and not have one , instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $ 700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node445">It 's always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people , many of whom are poor , and depend on that money</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node450">I just think it 's fundamentally lying to the people and stealing from them</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node455">we should n't be doing it</span> .

Thirty Seconds , finally</span> . <br><br>HUCKABEE : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node607">you ask about how we fund it</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node628">One of the reasons that <span class="highlighted" id="node633">Social Security is in so much trouble</span> is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node654">The people who get wages is declining dramatically</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node661">Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and -- and capital gains</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node666">The FairTax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node671">the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody , including illegals , prostitutes , pimps , drug dealers , all the people [ timer sounds ] that are freeloading off the system now</span> .

[ applause ] Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node1">I do n't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight</span> , but I remind everyone , <span class="highlighted" id="node6">there are two more presidential debates scheduled</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node13">We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important , and we 're going to press for specifics</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node20">I am honored to have this role , but this evening belongs to the candidates and , just as important , to the American people</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node27">Candidates , we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions , as well as your visions and your values</span> . So , <span class="highlighted" id="node35">let 's begin</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node42">We 're calling this opening segment `` Achieving Prosperity</span> . '' <span class="highlighted" id="node50">And central to that is jobs</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node57">There are two economic realities in America today</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node64">There 's been a record six straight years of job growth , and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation</span> . However , <span class="highlighted" id="node90">income inequality remains significant , and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck</span>.Beginning with you , Secretary Clinton , <span class="highlighted" id="node101">why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works</span> ? <br><br>CLINTON : Well , <span class="highlighted" id="node108">thank you</span> , Lester , and <span class="highlighted" id="node113">thanks to Hofstra for hosting us</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node122">The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we 'll build together</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node127">Today is my granddaughter 's second birthday</span> , so <span class="highlighted" id="node136">I think about this a lot</span> . First , <span class="highlighted" id="node148">we have to build an economy that works for everyone , not just those at the top</span> . That means <span class="highlighted" id="node155">we need new jobs , good jobs , with rising incomes</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node166">I want us to invest in you</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node174">I want us to invest in your future</span> . That means <span class="highlighted" id="node185">jobs in infrastructure , in advanced manufacturing , innovation and technology , clean , renewable energy , and small business</span> , because <span class="highlighted" id="node190">most of the new jobs will come from small business</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node223">We also have to make the economy fairer</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node230">That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee , finally , equal pay for women 's work</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node241">I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node252">If you help create the profits , you should be able to share in them , not just the executives at the top</span>.And <span class="highlighted" id="node263">I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node270">I 've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you 're under</span> . So <span class="highlighted" id="node275">let 's have paid family leave , earned sick days</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node280">Let 's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node285">How are we going to do it</span> ? <span class="highlighted" id="node290">We 're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes</span>.Finally , <span class="highlighted" id="node323">we tonight are on the stage together , Donald Trump and I</span>. Donald , <span class="highlighted" id="node330">it 's good to be with you</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node337">We 're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node344">You have to judge us , who can shoulder the immense , awesome responsibilities of the presidency , who can put into action the plans that will make your life better</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node351">I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th</span>.<br><br>HOLT : Secretary Clinton , <span class="highlighted" id="node358">thank you</span>.Mr . Trump , <span class="highlighted" id="node402">the same question to you</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node381">It 's about putting moneyâ€”more money into the pockets of American workers</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node397">You have up to two minutes</span>.<br><br>TRUMP : <span class="highlighted" id="node415">Thank you</span> , Lester . <span class="highlighted" id="node422">Our jobs are fleeing the country</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node429">They 're going to Mexico</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node434">They 're going to many other countries</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node447">You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node458">They 're devaluing their currency</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node465">there 's nobody in our government to fight them</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node476">we have a very good fight</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node483">we have a winning fight</span> . Because <span class="highlighted" id="node496">they 're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node501">many other countries are doing the same thing</span>.So <span class="highlighted" id="node506">we 're losing our good jobs , so many of them</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node525">When you look at what 's happening in Mexico , a friend of mine who builds plants said it 's the eighth wonder of the world</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node536">They 're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world , some of the most sophisticated , some of the best plants</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node547">With the United States , as he said , not so much</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node552">So Ford is leaving</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node563">You see that , their small car division leaving</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node574">Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan , leaving Ohio</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node594">They 're all leaving</span> .

Of course , <span class="highlighted" id="node866">we are 5 percent of the world 's population ; we have to trade with the other 95 percent</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node873">we need to have smart , fair trade deals</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node884">We also , though , need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions</span> . And <span class="highlighted" id="node891">the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again</span> . In fact , <span class="highlighted" id="node896">it would be the most extreme version , the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we 've ever had</span>.I call it <span class="highlighted" id="node901">trumped-up trickle-down , because that 's exactly what it would be</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node906">That is not how we grow the economy</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node911">We just have a different view about what 's best for growing the economy , how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes</span>.I think <span class="highlighted" id="node950">we come at it from somewhat different perspectives</span> . I understand that . You know , <span class="highlighted" id="node962">Donald was very fortunate in his life , and that 's all to his benefit</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node969">He started his business with $ 14 million , borrowed from his father</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node984">he really believes that the more you help wealthy people , the better off we 'll be and that everything will work out from there</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node991">I do n't buy that</span> .<br><br>CLINTON: <span class="highlighted" id="node2">I have a different experience</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node7">My father was a small-businessman</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node14">He worked really hard</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node43">He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and <span class="highlighted" id="node42">dump</span>ed the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going</span>.<br>And so <span class="highlighted" id="node60">what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node67">the better we will be off and the better we'll grow</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node72">That's the kind of economy I want us to see again</span>.<br><br><br><br>HOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. <span class="highlighted" id="node48">You've talked about creating 25 million jobs</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node55">you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node62">How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node69">How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?</span><br><br>TRUMP: Well, for one thingâ€”and before we start on thatâ€”<span class="highlighted" id="node76">my father gave me a very small loan in 1975</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node81">I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node90">I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs</span>.<br><span class="highlighted" id="node97">Our country's in deep trouble</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node116">We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node151">They're the best</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node124">the best ever at it</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node129">What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing</span>.<br>So <span class="highlighted" id="node141">we have to do that</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node146">We have to renegotiate our trade deals</span>.
